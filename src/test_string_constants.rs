Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to
visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening
after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner.
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:

“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”

“We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother resentfully, “since we are
not to visit.”

“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that
Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”

“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a
selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.”

“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving
you.”

Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of
her daughters.

“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You
tear them to pieces.”

“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.”

“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is your next ball to be,
Lizzy?”

“To-morrow fortnight.”

“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it
will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”

“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.”

“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so
teasing?”

“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot
know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture somebody else will;
and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think
it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”

The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense, nonsense!”

“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do you consider the forms of
introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you
there. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great
books and make extracts.”

Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.

“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.”

“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.

“I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this
morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid
the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the
rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had
expected all the while.

“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure
you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is
such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till
now.”

“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the
room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was shut. “I do not know how
you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life
it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your
sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley
will dance with you at the next ball.”

“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I’m the tallest.”

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and
determining when they should ask him to dinner."#;

Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,
And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,
Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.
Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,
And in the doubtful war, before he won
The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;
His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,
And settled sure succession in his line,
From whence the race of Alban fathers come,
And the long glories of majestic Rome.
O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;
What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;
For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began
To persecute so brave, so just a man;
Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,
Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!
Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,
Or exercise their spite in human woe?"#;
